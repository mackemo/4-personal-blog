The process included creating a form for blog title, content and author with a submit button. Once the button is pressed, a new page pops up showing the posts page with all of the blog posts. There is a back button to go back to the main page with the form. The blog posts are pulled from local storage and displayed on teh page. Included in the posts page is a toggle button to swtich from light and dark mode. At the bottom of the page include the link to the developer's portfolio.
